There has been an abundance of movie-watching here recently. Here's my summary; last night we watched \"Thirteen,\" a film every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched \"Gigli,\" yes, it was just as dreadful as the media proclaimed, but we had to see for ourselves."}
{"id": 2, "text": "Television in the summer used to be a wasteland replete with reruns and lackluster programming. However, now there are two outstanding new series on television, and I have been following both devotedly for the past week. \"Blow Out\" presents the most flamboyant concept imaginable, yet surprisingly features not a single openly gay individual. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin aims to establish a second venue for his immensely popular West Hollywood salon, but this time in Beverly Hills. Ordinarily, such news wouldn't pique my interest; certainly not mine, but as I was surfing through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan—both self-centered and uninspiring—surveying an empty space on Rodeo Drive and proclaiming (with grandiosity), \"I am going to construct here the greatest salon in the history of the world, ever!\" And that was all it took; I was captivated. Not since Rocco have I encountered such an imbecile who made for such enthralling television."}

Hopefully, someday I'll witness the entirety of a Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is correct concerning the issues with the shower; it's frustrating.

But the journey was worth it because the falls appeared serene, and the whole scene was indeed breathtaking. It's like you could hear yourself becoming one with nature.

The moment you begin to ascribe to a symbol—any symbol—that level of inflexible reverence and protection, you have taken a minor yet significant step toward totalitarianism.

The rate schedule active from August 2000 to September 2000 results in a considerably higher commodity charge because SDG&E customers are set to receive a substantial reimbursement from SDG&E during those two months. Consequently, SDG&E customers should anticipate lower electricity bills. Providing that the substantial reimbursement is excluded from the implied energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 stands at 6.2 cents, and the implied commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents.

I generally dislike prequels because they represent a regression in the storyline rather than advancement (a problem inherent to every prequel). Granted, they can expand on the narrative. The combat feels disjointed and lacks the precision that Arkham City achieved. As of writing this review (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (the main story is not affected). Some gadgets are assigned to an impractical hotkey, requiring your hand to traverse the entire keyboard to access it. It might seem trivial, but during combat, it could disrupt your combo."}

The restrictions on ammunition and elemental attributes subtly encourage the utilization of various weapons. Numerous distinctive (a key term here when contrasting SW2 with the repetitive Borderlands' RNG weapon system) weapons remain useful throughout most of the game. The music is outstanding, particularly the main theme, and of course, Stan Bush's contributions."}

I'm 1.87m in real life, created my first player with this height, and then realized I cannot achieve a skill higher than 89. Why? That's outright discrimination!

Edward was a truly intriguing character, as were all the supporting cast. I felt that the collectibles genuinely added value in this AC title, unlike what I experienced with any of the prior entries, possibly because they seemed more integral to the game. They certainly weren't mandatory, but collecting them was enjoyable and the rewards were well balanced."}
{"id": 102, "text": "While I personally cannot endorse this game, it wasn't abysmal. The gunplay is acceptable, provided you have the funds to acquire gun components, which constitutes my primary critique of this game: it's predicated on pay-to-win. If I could overlook that aspect, the game would be quite enjoyable, as the hardsuit is entertaining to operate, and HRV is an innovative concept. I'd prefer this game to any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction scheme is unpalatable for me. If you are comfortable with this model, then by all means, enjoy yourself.

I'm on my initial playthrough, and I lost my main character at about the 10th hour of roughly 20. I would have appreciated the option to reload a save at that juncture. I've since utilized a third-party mod/save tool to prevent devastating losses. Additionally, the aiming reticle is somewhat diminutive, and the zoom capability is inadequate. Despite these issues, it has been a thrill. I am not typically fond of zombie genres, but the blend of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is outstanding. I play as frequently as my schedule permits... Just one more mission, just one more supply run – or I'm fleeing to safety before closing the game."}

The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well – no, I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to master it. Do not get frustrated; you will lose many units.

Truly outstanding. It's not cheesy (okay, it's occasionally cheesy). And the various story characters each have their unique sense of humor. These distinct characters indeed possess unique personalities. As for the level design; it's simply superb. By the way, I never played the first Portal game.

Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is impeccable, and very much Generation One. But aside from that, it’s actually a very entertaining game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well-executed. Transforming mid-fight is often essential, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon’s excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the substantial focus on melee combat, though certain enemies (e.g., Seekers) necessitate a switch to a ranged blaster."}

You have to restart the client for it to function properly. Although it's not terribly inconvenient, why must I link my Steam and GFACE accounts? They claim it’s for DLC, but why is that necessary? Additionally, it’s irreversible, so now I'm aware that a company I'm indifferent about has access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it’s mediocre.

In my opinion, this is an outstanding and entertaining game, truly, even though the format can be slightly irritating (where the free-roam city area restocks with new adversaries each time you advance the story). I particularly relished the 'dual play' sequences (where you can control Batman and an additional character), and the option to utilize the controller for most parts of the game while reserving the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat sequences was highly appreciated. Navigating your Batmobile around the free-roaming city, especially when pursuing the APC commanders, becomes notably pleasurable once you learn how to use the brakes to drift around corners (and mastering this skill makes driving through the city thoroughly enjoyable!)."}

It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never discovered it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight.

What I enjoy about this game is that 2K introduced a fresh perspective and incorporated novel mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I found less enjoyable was that, at times, these new features made the game somewhat overwhelming. An aspect I believe could be enhanced is the inclusion of additional artwork within the game, such as the environments you encounter when communicating with another leader."}

It's intricately crafted as a survival horror where you must conserve your ammunition, attend to your wounds when you're bleeding, take medication when you're infected, etc. Moreover, the zombies appear very natural and are impressively animated for a free-to-play game.

{"id": 119, "text": "02/07/2014 - It's regrettable that I cannot wholeheartedly recommend or enjoy this game; despite the limited time I've spent with it, I'm certain I would be engrossed if it weren't for the following two major issues. Firstly, the absence of Australian servers—a single red bar leaves you substantially disadvantaged and results in intolerable lag. Keep in mind, I played through the offline training mode, and even there I experienced stutters and lag (how is that even possible?). Combined with the high ping, it utterly ruins the experience. Secondly, the visuals are extremely problematic—menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game elements all artifact excessively. I've never encountered such an issue with this graphics card and suspected it might be a conflict with my overclocking. Reverting the GPU to its factory settings proved fruitless; disappointingly, it had no impact."}
{"id": 120, "text": "Very late last night, I finished this. The story is not particularly deep or captivating, but what distinguishes it is the storytelling. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the multitude of collectibles excellently enhances it. I learned much about the world of Batman, so it was somewhat disappointing that there were so few bosses in the game. Oh well, there are sufficient future games to address that. The combat strikes the right balance in terms of challenge, although it leans more towards the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't particularly rewarding. It's the gadgets that you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which contribute to engaging new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously inaccessible areas provides a gratifying sense of progression."}

This masterpiece epitomizes the zenith of storytelling, in my view, and the soundtrack is a delightfully enchanting and faultless complement. Yes, the controls are somewhat cumbersome and the gameplay is not a highlight, but the narrative is so extraordinary that it didn't bother me in the slightest. Moreover, the wit of the game is excellent as well and it certainly does not detract from the esteemed nature of the story... And the 'Doctor Who' references are plentiful."}

The art style and music in the game are outstanding; everything appears immensely vibrant at times—who says the apocalypse has to be dreary? Best of all, the game features dynamic narration that responds to your actions. So, if you pick up a weapon and then exchange it for another in the armory, the narrator will comment on your selection of the new weapon."}
{"id": 123, "text": "I had originally purchased this game during its early development when the exclusive currency was spacebucks, and there was no 'tech tree'. That was when the game excelled. All weapons at that time were supremely powerful, resulting in no issues of imbalance; everyone had the capability to eliminate any opponent at any moment. Additionally, the game formerly granted unlimited weapon slots and five loadouts. You would assume that for a game boasting 'bajillions of guns', they would provide more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for expansion. At one juncture, I possessed approximately three pages' worth of weapons and was contemplating new concepts for more, because, personally, that's where I derived enjoyment."}
{"id": 124, "text": "This game was a surprising gem. One often encounters rave reviews of certain products that can sometimes be misleading. In this instance, the reviews accurately reflect the entertainment value of this neat little game. It is an unusual blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with panache. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically appreciate in other MOBA games. While I had anticipated this preference to persist, I decided to try playing as a melee tank regardless. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and subsequently experimented with more characters as they became available through gameplay. The art style and interface are peculiarly captivating. Consequently, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper derived from creating a card set for the game."}

I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counterattack. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"}

DmC serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers to immerse themselves in the series. It reveals the beginnings of an arrogant and cynical Dante, charting his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout the game, a coherent narrative arc for the refreshed Dante is woven, rendering him an engrossing character to follow. The story portrays Dante as he becomes acquainted with the corrupt world he had previously opted to disregard."}

It strikes a serious tone when necessary, yet it revels in humorous moments. The character design is impeccable, featuring a variety of characters with distinct personalities and secrets to uncover. It stands out from other RPGs because it allows you to progress without the need to vanquish anyone, which is a novel concept in RPGs. Drawing extensive inspiration from EarthBound, one of the finest RPGs I have encountered, you can discern its potential for greatness. It possesses what is arguably the best soundtrack I've listened to in a long time."}

Regarding my experience, the 'game' was ineffectual for me. A significant portion of the narrative relies on shock value. I was neither shocked nor emotionally stirred by it in the slightest. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or it may have been too straightforward to elicit a response from me. As for the remaining portion of the game, it attempts to illustrate (metaphorically) a person's mental deterioration. It addresses obsession, hallucinations, depression, and several other issues. Conceptually, it is an intriguing idea. However, the 'game' took me merely 10 minutes to complete, and that was with reading and absorbing every scrap of information I could."}

It is a remarkable way to test your mind while still being entertaining. Though this game isn't as rich in narrative, it did inspire one of the most distinguished and popular games of 2011. I still play this game to defeat boredom, and I cherish the opportunity to revisit what laid the foundation for a legend and what has become a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite straightforward to describe. You utilize portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle.

The total of approximately 650€ certainly falls within the mid-range category; though it's fair to say, this setup is fairly recent.

I try (read: endeavor not to be) to avoid being overly biased due to the fact that this game enables you to transform into a dragon, assisting your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, movement, and spawning simultaneously.

When I played versions 1.00 through 1.03, my game never crashed, and I didn’t encounter any bugs. I’ve also noticed that after the 1.03 patch, the draw distance has occasionally been poor, with objects starting to render when you’re extremely close, sometimes even with characters. However, if we overlook these bugs, crashes, and draw distance issues, this is an outstanding game.

Rounds descend over distance and short, controlled bursts are necessary if you wish to maintain accuracy. There is no infinite ammunition reserve.

Instead of detecting the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system quantifies the pulse duration, that is, the time required for the voltage to return to its baseline. This eliminates the need for power-intensive and bulky analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated using the TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW with a 1.2 V analog and digital power supply.

However, the essentially linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to a wider array of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, initial optomechanical proposals recognized the potential to circumvent this limitation by establishing strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.

To ensure high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a set of solutions leading to exact transfers, where the solutions adhere to a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Within this set, we identified a tracking solution that allows control over the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and the robustness with a single parameter. We define the robustness of an ultra-high fidelity transfer as the minimum percent deviation in the pulse areas at which the infidelity exceeds $10^{-4}$. The resilience of our shaped pulses is superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."}

Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima that are not globally optimal exist, even when the mixture is well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima share a common structural form that partially identifies the component centers of the actual mixture, meaning that each local minimum involves a distinct combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings pertain to the scenario where the genuine mixture components meet a specified separation criterion, and remain valid whether the number of components is overestimated or underestimated. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain more precise results in terms of the dependency on the separation distance between components."}

These can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and possess a more intricate multipolar structure, providing insights that may help to restrict fuzzball models phenomenologically. We uncover numerical evidence indicating that all multipole moments are typically more substantial (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with equivalent mass and angular momentum.

We examine a frequent scenario in which edges represent either ephemeral interactions (e.g., messaging) or enduring structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, enduring edges are often established by individuals. Manually established edges can be both costly to generate and suboptimal for subsequent tasks. To mitigate these problems, we introduce a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that deduces temporal attention between nodes by monitoring node communication. As temporal attention steers feature propagation between nodes, utilizing the dynamics of node interactions to discern this crucial element provides increased flexibility while concurrently circumventing complications associated with manually established edges."}
{"id": 210, "text": "Observations of thermally induced transverse vibrations of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) are presented. The PCW comprises two parallel nanobeams with a 240 nm vacuum gap between them. Models are formulated and confirmed for the conversion of beam movement into phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe traversing in a guided mode (GM) of the PCW at probe frequencies both far from and close to the dielectric band edge. Given that our PCW is designed for near-field atom trapping, this study lays the groundwork for assessing potential adverse effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps in proximity to the surfaces of PCWs. The long-term objectives include establishing robust atom-mediated interactions between individual phonons of vibration and solitary photons traveling in the GMs of the PCW, thus facilitating optomechanics at the quantum level involving atoms, photons, and phonons."}

In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of consecutive dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in these separations stems from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum constitute a global Mackey functor, so the separations imply that certain lengthy exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\\mathbf{MO}$ and $\\mathbf{MU}$, the separations suggest the regularity of various Euler classes associated with the tautological representations of $O(n)$ and $U(n)$."}

In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to categorize audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech.

The reference to a true, albeit unknown, population structure enables us to frame the clustering issue within a conventional inferential context, where the idea of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition generated by the actual density function. The nonparametric version of this method, known as modal clustering, establishes a relationship between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is essential, and a careful selection of the degree of smoothing, dictating the contour of the density and thereby potentially the modal structure, is pivotal for determining the final partition. In this work, we address the challenge of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic standpoint."}

Nonetheless, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes impose an impediment to the straightforward interference contributions from dimension-six operators, leading to a cancellation of the total diboson rate correction's principal contribution. In this context, meticulous measurement of the azimuthal decay angles \"revives\" the interference, reclaiming sensitivity to the \"non-interfering\" operators. We investigate these phenomena in depth and determine that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are exceptionally mitigated by the formulation of an asymmetry variable, which is exclusively induced by these non-interfering operators, demoting the impact of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same level as statistical fluctuations in this measurement."}

Like others before us, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which encompasses causal inference). An explicit categorization of data science tasks is essential to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytical methods required to successfully complete each task.

The prevailing view is that these particles are postulated to assure that extremal black holes remain either unstable or on the cusp of stability, yet the implications of their absence are unclear. This note demonstrates that, within a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously established quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy. Resolving this discrepancy leads to a nonperturbative formulation of the WGC, which, in the regime of weak coupling, converges to the conventional assertion. The rationale is universal, independent of supersymmetry or specific UV completions, relying solely on the soundness of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."}

Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as pristine and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, yet direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our findings establish ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful platform for elucidating the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."}
{"id": 219, "text": "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are mathematical models used in numerous application areas such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering due to their intuitive approach to modeling. Despite the ODEs' extensive application in modeling, the frequent lack of their analytic solutions complicates the estimation of ODE parameters from data, particularly when the model encompasses numerous variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is both rapid and precise, even for models with multiple parameters. The suggested method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on the equations of a numerical solver. It enables swift estimation by circumventing the computations of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood.

We ascertain the impact of a chiral chemical potential, namely, the electron population disparity between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we detect a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are engendered through Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is contrary in the two WSM regions and markedly sensitive to the chirality disparity and excitation energy."}

Importantly, it offers a strategy for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby enhancing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern regarding the use of this technique is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. Here we report on our investigation of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results reveal that after an initial decline of as much as 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very gradual reduction of about 10% over the subsequent year."}

The associated charge corresponds to the Skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Furthermore, there exist singular configurations that can be recognized as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this characterization, the vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current represents the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This hypothesis provides a cohesive framework for the two varieties of baryons and allows them to seamlessly transition from one to the other in a natural manner. Additionally, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as stemming from a Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."}

Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface engenders significant transverse Hall supercurrents, which we denote as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially devised to calculate conventional Josephson current flows, to assess the transverse current components and demonstrate that their magnitudes can be extensively tuned by altering the spin-orbit coupling intensities or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a definitive spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-defined subgap bound states emerge around the interface."}

(2020), that dipoles are as significant to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it has been discovered that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated currents formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices split into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, more slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a gradually evolving 'crystal.' The kinematics of both families are highly distinct, and only the former displays self-similarity. The latter accounts for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices constitute the dipoles and the currents. Mechanisms for the growth of this slower component are considered."}

Often, the running time of quantum algorithms within this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the period required for the quantum walk to locate a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to numerous CTQW-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, enhancing their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $O(n^5)$ to $O(n^2\\log n)$. Moreover, our methods also contribute to exponentially improving the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al.

Dry (or \"loss-cone\") EMRIs, previously considered as the principal EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are predominantly generated by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we underscore an alternative EMRI formation pathway: wet EMRI formation facilitated by the accretion flow around accreting Galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this pathway, the accretion disk ensnares stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and consequently encourages them to migrate towards the MBH - this process elevates the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."}

To counteract this, fuzzers are equipped with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that identify the most compact subset of seeds that triggers the same spectrum of instrumentation data points as the entire corpus. It is generally accepted that reducing both the quantity and cumulative size of the seeds conduces to more efficient fuzzing, an assertion we investigate in depth.

Additionally, this method employs, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not limited to the rectangular one, at the stage prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are harnessed for the rapid implementation of matrix inversions.

We employed a differential excitation protocol to isolate the high spatial frequency details. By varying the excitation laser's intensity, the spatial resolution of imaging was enhanced by approximately 1.6 times relative to that of confocal microscopy.

With a slight adjustment of this scenario, slenderer belts might emerge if the planetesimals are inherently eccentric, potentially due to previous planet perturbations during the gas-enriched protoplanetary disk phase. Nonetheless, an original eccentricity could also originate from instabilities that amplify the disk’s eccentricity, without the necessity for any planets."}

Michelangelo said that when he gazed upon uncarved marble, he perceived a figure struggling to emerge. The chisel was Michelangelo's sole instrument. Yet, living entities are not sculpted. They evolve. And within our smallest units of life, our cells, we contain all the information necessary for every other cell to operate and to duplicate. Tools also have repercussions. Since at least the Industrial Revolution, the realm of design has been governed by the demands of manufacturing and mass production."}

This was the dilemma confronting those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the targets of paranoia about the supernatural, misguided religious zeal, and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth.

Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living organisms: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living organisms perish, much of their stored carbon eventually returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and marine life transforms into rock, and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon sequestered in rock. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also emit this ancient carbon. Today, humans discharge approximately 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."}

When we equip them with jet packs or subject them to disturbances such as an earthquake, we ascertain that their exquisitely calibrated legs enable them to self-stabilize without employing any neural processing. They can navigate intricate terrain like grass effortlessly and remain unfazed.

We can convey incredibly complex thoughts to one another. What I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm creating tones and hisses and puffs, and these are generating air vibrations. These air vibrations are traveling to you, they're impacting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and converts them into thoughts. I hope. (Laughter) I hope that's occurring. Because of this capability, we humans can share our ideas across vast expanses of space and time. We're able to transfer knowledge between minds."}

I enjoy working with media and technology for two reasons: firstly, I'm proficient with them and appreciate the influence they wield, and secondly, I despise them and am petrified by the influence they hold.

Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human.  Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It's sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress.  Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has convened a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses highlight that past periods in Earth's history were warmer than the 20th century."}

Another aspect to consider is the privilege it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk, especially here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, tarnished by the expenses scandal, has reached an all-time low. There was even a story recently about scientists contemplating the replacement of rats with politicians in their experiments. And when someone inquired, \"Why?\" they responded, \"Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really cares what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats simply refuse to do.\" (Laughter) Now, I know you all appreciate data, so I am beginning with a data-rich slide."}
