One show features hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who's on a mission to open a second location for his wildly successful West Hollywood salon - this time in posh Beverly Hills. While I wouldn't normally care about such news, I happened to catch a glimpse of Jonathan passionately declaring (in a loud, public voice) that he'll create \"the greatest salon in the history of the world\" in an empty Rodeo Drive space. His bold statement piqued my interest, and I find him just as captivating as Rocco, another memorable reality TV personality."}

As a result, any excessive arm movement - particularly when using a computer mouse - becomes excruciating. Unfortunately, this has limited my ability to create artwork due to the discomfort. Additionally, lack of sleep has exacerbated the pain. Despite these setbacks, I remain hopeful about recovering soon. On a positive note, my mother's recent surgery was successful, and her eyesight has slightly improved. Although she remains largely blind, she can now distinguish fuzzy shapes and recognize colors. We're hoping that her vision will continue to improve in the near future."}

Granted, I'm pleased to extend my expertise and provide assistance to those in need, but there's a fine line between generosity and being taken advantage of. The past few weeks have seen me burning the midnight oil, indulging in some reading and other activities, so I had looked forward to catching some shut-eye earlier than usual.

{"id": 8, "text": "Two issues with the scenario described in my previous post are problematic. Firstly, while Bush may be stimulating the economy, he's doing so in the wrong way. As former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin pointed out on NPR's Marketplace, temporary tax cuts targeted at low- and moderate-income individuals would have produced the same stimulative effect without saddling future generations with excessive debt. It's worth noting that Rubin's reputation for fiscal prudence is well-deserved; indeed, naming another Bush administration official with similar gravitas on domestic policy matters is a challenge. The second issue is that granting Republicans control solely during wartime is untenable since they've cleverly conjured up a never-ending, global \"War on Terror\" pretext."}

But let's face it, such philosophical musings can also be tinged with a sense of sadness, especially when they occur during an excruciatingly long block schedule.

With only 14 inches completed, I had already invested around $10 worth of yarn (at $8 per skein), but the fabric was riddled with issues. The excessive number of stitches made it difficult to navigate the armholes, causing the mohair to tangle and knot as I worked. Attempts to frog (rip out rows) were unsuccessful, resulting in frequent yarn breakage. Despite my frustration, I remained composed and focused on the task at hand, accompanied by the second season of Sex and the City (thanks, library!). Ultimately, I grew tired of wrestling with the sweater and decided to abandon it. While the experience was challenging, I gained valuable insights into the nuances of knitting, making it a learning opportunity despite the disappointment."}

We have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always opportunity for a quick match. Recently, I took part in an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, jukebox, DVD rentals, pool table, dartboard, and, of course, a ubiquitous ping pong table).

The water was frigid, and the numbing sensation it induced was quite an experience. Unfortunately, we couldn't stay long, as we had to move on to the nearby waterfalls, which required another 30-minute hike.

Furthermore, the characters were underdeveloped, which made it difficult for me to invest in their journeys.

With its sleek design and impressive features, it's sure to give other native apps a run for their money.

{"id": 74, "text": "The concept of ahimsa, which means 'noninjury to living beings,' has been a guiding principle in my life. Derived from the Sanskrit words 'a-' meaning 'not' and 'himsati' meaning 'he injures,' ahimsa encourages us to avoid causing harm to any living being. As I grew older, my understanding of ahimsa deepened, and I became increasingly mindful of my thoughts and words. In fact, certain phrases in our national anthem, such as 'scatter her enemies and make them fall' and 'confound their policies, frustrate their knavish tricks,' have always resonated deeply with me, as they align with my belief in ahimsa. Mahatma Gandhi, who was born on this day, October 2nd, in 1869, also embraced the principles of ahimsa throughout his life. Although he lived over two centuries ago, his teachings remain relevant today, offering valuable insights into how we can live our lives with compassion, empathy, and respect for all living beings."}

Note that the latter will require some time to complete. Also, I wonder if we should disable auto-confirms, since creating a VNG deal triggers a faxed confirmation to the customer.

For now, my plan is to record sales at the city gate or storage facility and perform most pricing calculations in a worksheet for ease."}

I have nothing but praise for this game as it has surpassed my expectations and likely will yours too. Its fluid movement, lack of bugs and crashes, and abundant storyline and content make it stand out. The various options available each day, including multiple practice sessions, sponsored events, and games, are also impressive. My review is solely based on playing MyCareer mode, which has been flawless thus far, scoring a perfect 10/10. The FaceScan feature works great; I used it twice, and although the first attempt gave me a Down syndrome-like forehead, the second try was spot on. Remember, utilizing the MyNBA2K17 app allows you to FaceScan for free and earn daily VC. #sellout."}
{"id": 97, "text": "Magic fans, beware! Wizards is hesitant to create a quality digital game that truly captures the essence of Magic: The Gathering. At its core, Magic is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends or rivals, where laughter, trash talk, and game-winning moves are essential. Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast appears to have overlooked this aspect. If you opt to play with companions, you won't earn gold, which is a crucial component. Gold is so vital that a daily cap has been put in place, understandably, since it unlocks all in-game content. However, prepare for a tedious and solitary 1v1 grind against AI opponents or strangers, without the possibility of communication. Alternatively, playing for free will require approximately four hours per day for several weeks, spent alone, to obtain the desired cards."}
{"id": 98, "text": "\"As the third installment in the trilogy, I'll start by addressing my main grievances. While I appreciate the additional storyline depth that prequels offer, I generally dislike them because they move the narrative backward instead of forward. Moreover, the combat mechanics in Arkham Origins feel somewhat clumsy and lack the precision that Arkham City delivered so well. At the time of writing (October 26, 2013), a game-breaking bug hinders the completion of a side mission, although the main story remains unaffected. Furthermore, some gadgets are assigned to awkward key bindings, forcing me to stretch my fingers across the entire keyboard during combat, which can disrupt my combos.\" "}
{"id": 99, "text": "Shadow Warrior (2013) received significant improvements, making it an enjoyable experience. Notably, the boss fights are now incredibly engaging, and weaponry feels satisfying, although perhaps not as polished as in D44M. Enemies pose a reasonable challenge, provided players manage elemental and upgrade aspects effectively. The upgrade system boasts impressive balance, becoming less tiresome after familiarization. Innovative weapon variety remains useful throughout the game, setting Shadow Warrior apart from Borderlands' randomized arsenal. Additionally, the soundtrack features memorable tracks, including the iconic main theme and Stan Bush's contributions."}
{"id": 100, "text": "I'm struggling to write this review because so many things are frustrating me about my career mode experience. Firstly, I don't understand why the shooting skill is dependent on a player's height. It doesn't make sense that a player who is 1.74m tall cannot become as skilled at shooting as a player who is 1.71m tall. In real life, I'm 1.87m tall, and when I created my first player with this height, I noticed that I couldn't reach a higher skill level than 89, no matter how much I played. That feels like pure discrimination! Moreover, the game didn't warn me about this limitation before I created my character, nor did it inform me when I reached the skill limit after weeks of playing. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into something only to realize that there's an arbitrary barrier preventing me from improving."}
{"id": 101, "text": "I believe Assassin's Creed has perfected its mechanics across various aspects, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, and more. This installment also features a particularly captivating protagonist, making me feel more emotionally invested in the story. Although the narrative begins on a rocky note, it significantly improves as the game progresses - a common trait among AC games, in my opinion. Additionally, the supporting cast is intriguing, and I found Edward to be a compelling character. One aspect that sets this game apart is how collectibles serve a greater purpose and offer a sense of accomplishment without feeling obligatory. While they aren't essential, obtaining them is enjoyable, and the rewards are well-balanced, further enhancing the gaming experience."}
{"id": 102, "text": "While I can't personally recommend this game, it wasn't entirely terrible. The gunplay is acceptable, provided you have the resources to buy gun parts – my primary gripe with the game being its pay-to-win format. If I could look past that, the game has some redeeming qualities, such as the entertaining hardsuit mechanics and innovative HRV feature. However, the pay-to-win microtransaction model remains a turnoff for me. If you're comfortable with this type of monetization, feel free to give it a try. Otherwise, like me, you might want to pass on this one since it doesn't align with our preference for non-pay-to-win games."}
{"id": 103, "text": "Although not flawless, this game has been immensely enjoyable. The save system and risk of unexpected death have led to occasional frustration, such as when I lost my primary character around hour 10 of my first playthrough. A save-and-reload feature would have been helpful then. To mitigate this issue, I've adopted a third-party mod/save tool. Additionally, the aiming reticle could be larger, and the zoom function slightly more powerful. Despite these minor drawbacks, the game has been incredibly engaging; I'm not typically a fan of zombie games, but the mix of strategic elements, missions, first-person shooting, and beat-em-up mechanics has captivated me. My playtime has been frequent, often leaving me eager for 'just one more mission' or 'one more supply run' before calling it quits."}
{"id": 104, "text": "This is an absolutely fantastic strategy game! Having played every other wargame in the series (European Escalation and Alb), I can confidently say that this installment fits perfectly into the franchise. The sheer number of units available is impressive - I won't give away the exact count, but let's just say there are plenty! The graphics are breathtaking, the sound design is superb, and the gameplay is truly epic. Even the in-game chat box at the main menu provides some entertainment value. Be warned though, this game isn't a walk in the park, especially for those new to the strategy genre. It may take some time to master, and you'll likely lose a few units along the way. But don't worry, with careful planning, a strong emphasis on anti-air and anti-tank measures, and perseverance, victory will be within your grasp."}

My skepticism stemmed from my initial confusion about the concept of portal guns and portals, despite my fondness for science fiction. However, my doubts were quickly dispelled once I started playing. The humor and voice acting in the game are truly exceptional, striking the perfect balance between wit and silliness. Each character has a distinct personality, showcased through their unique brand of humor. Additionally, the level design is inventive and engaging. While I haven't played the original Portal, I'm eager to try it out someday when I have the chance. In fact, I might not have ever tried Portal 2 if I hadn't been convinced by its excellence."}

The game offers some of the best characters, a good storyline, loads of content, customizable character options (including gender preference), and the ability to pursue romantic relationships with most companions. However, it does have some drawbacks such as poor graphics, awkward love scenes, invisible walls, and a few dull missions. One thing to note is that your protagonist cannot speak, but this isn't necessarily a negative aspect for me. Overall, I love this game! It's probably one of the best RPGs or games in general that I've ever played, so if you're an RPG fan, you likely already own it.\" "}
{"id": 107, "text": "For those in their thirties, playing this game might evoke nostalgic memories of watching the annoying Timmy Mallett on TV, all for the sake of catching the briefTransformers cartoon. Thankfully, the voice cast reprises their iconic roles, including Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, and numerous others, which adds to the game's charm. The signature transformation sound effects are also unmistakably Generation One. Visually, the cel-shaded graphics are flawless, capturing the retro feel without any compromise. While the game may seem like a mere throwback at first glance, its combat mechanics deserve high praise. Transformation plays a crucial role in combat, often requiring you to change forms mid-battle, which flows smoothly into combination attacks. Unlike High Moon's War for/Fall of Cybertron titles, this game emphasizes melee combat, although certain foes, such as Seekers, demand a strategic shift to ranged weaponry."}
{"id": 108, "text": "I downloaded the game and played it for a brief period, but it didn't impress me. In fact, I spent more time attempting to log in than I did playing the game. There's a frustrating bug that prevents successful login; every time I tried to accept the updated terms of service, the prompt would simply reappear. The only solution is to restart the client. While this issue isn't catastrophic, I'm annoyed that I'm required to link my Steam and GFace accounts. The supposed reason for this is to receive DLC, but I question its necessity. Moreover, once linked, the connection cannot be undone, which means a company I have no interest in now has access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it's unremarkable and blatantly inspired by Call of Duty. Somehow, the developers managed to make the gunplay inferior to the original, which is a remarkable achievement."}

Keep in mind that there is some skippable dialogue, but feel free to use either a gamepad or a keyboard and mouse configuration, both of which are fully rebindable. At its price point, I wouldn't have hesitated to make a purchase, especially considering over half of the DLC is included for free, providing ample content to enjoy.

{"id": 110, "text": "I didn't encounter any performance issues at launch, and after all the patches, the game runs smoothly. In my opinion, this is a truly entertaining and engaging game, despite some minor frustrations with the format (specifically, the free-roam city area respawning new enemies as you progress through the story). The \"dual play\" segments, where I could play as Batman accompanied by another character, were especially enjoyable. Additionally, having the option to switch between using a controller and mouse and keyboard for different parts of the game, such as the tank combat sequences, was much appreciated. Lastly, once I got the hang of using the brakes to skid around corners while driving the Batmobile, cruising around the free-roam city became genuinely enjoyable, and later on, it became second nature."}

The game boasts impressive visuals, engaging gameplay, a compelling narrative, memorable characters, flawless voice acting, and an epic soundtrack. However, it's not suitable for the faint of heart, as some cutscenes can be quite graphic and intense. While the game's overall quality makes its few flaws more noticeable, I did encounter a couple of issues: lack of SLI support, which forced me to upgrade my GPU; and occasionally, small obstacles that proved surprisingly difficult to climb. Nonetheless, ensure you have a relatively powerful single GPU card before diving into this thrilling experience."}

There are no unnecessary details, and the color schemes are great. The graphics can be set to high without putting too much strain on your system. I run the game on an Intel Core i5 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M GPU and 8GB of RAM under Windows 8.1, and it performs smoothly.

However, don't assume that it's similar to COD, Battlefield, or any other first-person shooter game. It's a unique experience in its own right, and players should approach it as such. I've heard too many new players complaining about getting killed quickly, as if they expect to be invincible. Newsflash: dying is part of the game, just like in real life. After sinking considerable time and money into it, I can confidently say that it's one of the best multiplayer games out there, perfect for when you need a break from CS:GO."}

Even if you're new to the genre, the game's humor is sure to bring a smile to your face. And let's just say that fans of Final Fantasy 7 or X are in for a real treat.

{"id": 115, "text": "I apologize sincerely, as I genuinely attempt to advocate for free-to-play games and independent developers. Unfortunately, this particular title failed to impress me despite its promising description. As an enthusiast of puzzle and exploration games, I was excited about the prospect of immersing myself in this experience. However, I found the gameplay to be utterly unintuitive, which made progression difficult even after consulting guides. Moreover, the absence of a pause button – or at least, one that I couldn't locate – proved problematic since many sequences feature time constraints. This omission feels particularly glaring given the game's emphasis on timing. Additionally, I felt that the game relies excessively on cutscenes, leaving me idle for extended periods, eagerly awaiting the opportunity to engage with the gameplay."}
{"id": 116, "text": "Wow, where do I even begin? This game was stunningly beautiful, both in terms of its captivating narrative and breathtaking visuals. From the get-go, I found myself completely immersed in the story, feeling as though I was the protagonist uncovering the mysteries of the plot. The gameplay was engaging and challenging, and I discovered a lot about myself through the experience - including my previously unknown fear of heights, which was triggered by the nerve-wracking ice caverns! Despite the anxiety it caused me, I persevered for Uncle Fred's sake, and I'm thrilled that I did. If there's ever a DLC or sequel, I'll be the first in line to purchase it and recommend it to all my friends. Kudos to every single person involved in creating this masterpiece; you've crafted a truly exceptional gaming experience."}

One aspect I appreciate about this game is how 2K Games introduced fresh mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer, providing a unique twist to the series. However, I found the addition of these features also made the game overwhelming at times. To further enhance the player's experience, incorporating more diverse environmental artwork during diplomatic interactions with other leaders would be a welcome improvement."}

After logging over 60 hours, I can confidently say that this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games out there. The gameplay is designed like a true survival horror experience, where you must carefully manage your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, and take pills to cure infections. The zombies are also impressively lifelike, especially considering it's a free-to-play game. While playing with friends is always recommended, the community is super friendly, and you can easily make new friends or engage in chat or voice comms. Overall, this game offers an immersive and thrilling experience that any zombie game enthusiast would enjoy."}
{"id": 119, "text": "February 7th, 2014 - It's unfortunate that I cannot wholeheartedly recommend or enjoy this game, despite its potential for addiction. The lack of Australian servers significantly hinders my experience, as a single red bar results in a substantial disadvantage and intolerable lag. Notably, the offline training mode still experiences stuttering and lag, which raises concerns about the game's optimization. Additionally, the abundance of graphical artifacts, including distortions in menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game elements, detracts from the overall quality. Although I initially suspected that my overclocked GPU might be the cause, reverting it to stock settings did not resolve the issue."}
{"id": 120, "text": "I completed this game very late last night, and while the story may not be particularly deep or captivating, the exceptional storytelling and immersive atmosphere make it stand out. The numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing out the world of Batman, although I did find it somewhat disappointing that there were only a few boss battles throughout the game. Nevertheless, there are plenty of opportunities for future games to address this. The combat system offers just the right amount of challenge, leaning slightly towards the easier side. However, leveling up Batman didn't feel as rewarding as I had hoped. Instead, it was the various gadgets and abilities that I upgraded and acquired throughout the campaign that added fresh gameplay mechanics and made exploring previously inaccessible areas a thrilling experience."}

Among the most memorable experiences of my life, it surpasses even The Walking Dead in its emotional impact. I've rarely felt such a mix of profound sorrow and satisfaction from a work of fiction. This masterpiece represents the zenith of storytelling, complemented by a beautifully crafted soundtrack that perfectly captures the mood. Although the controls can be slightly tricky, and the gameplay may not be the main draw, the narrative is so exceptional that I found myself completely absorbed. Moreover, the game's sense of humor is delightful and doesn't detract from the gravity of the story. In fact, Doctor Who fans will appreciate the numerous nods to the beloved franchise scattered throughout."}
{"id": 122, "text": "Bastion is an incredibly engaging game with a captivating storyline. After a catastrophic event, the game takes place in a world where you must rebuild and restore order. The game offers numerous choices that impact your playstyle, such as deciding which structures to construct, which weapons to wield, and which power-ups and bonuses to utilize. The vibrant art style and immersive soundtrack complement the post-apocalyptic setting, making the game feel anything but dull. One of the standout features is the dynamic narration, which responds to your actions as a player, adding a unique touch to the gameplay experience. For example, if you swap out one weapon for another, the narrator will acknowledge your decision, further immerging you in the game's world."}
{"id": 123, "text": "I purchased this game during its early development phase when the sole currency was spacebux and there was no such thing as a \"tech tree.\" This was a great time to play the game, as all weapons were balanced, meaning there was no issue with imbalance, and anyone could kill anyone at any given moment. Additionally, the game offered unlimited gun slots and five loadouts, which was generous considering the vast array of weapons available. However, I felt that with so many weapons, the game should have provided more than six weapon slots and three loadouts without requiring payment for additional upgrades. In fact, at one point, I had amassed around three pages' worth of guns and was brainstorming new ideas for more, as that aspect of the game was particularly enjoyable for me."}
{"id": 124, "text": "This game turned out to be a hidden gem, defying my initial expectations. While some product reviews can be misleading, in this case, they accurately reflected the game's entertainment value. It seamlessly blends elements of a classic 2D platformer and MOBA, making it a unique and stylish experience. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically prefer in other MOBA games. Curious about its mechanics, I decided to try out a melee tank character, and much to my surprise, I enjoyed playing it. In fact, I became so engrossed that I continued to play and unlock more characters. The game's quirky art style and user-friendly interface only added to its charm, prompting me to adopt one of the characters as my avatar and create a card set featuring its distinctive visuals."}
{"id": 125, "text": "I'm thoroughly enjoying this game, having recently started playing. I can easily get lost in it for hours at a time, donning my headphones and immersing myself in the engaging gameplay. It's been a while since a game has had such a captivating effect on me. The music creates an atmosphere that complements the game perfectly, while the sound effects are spot on. The controls are also well-designed, making combat encounters a sheer delight. In fact, I eagerly anticipate each skirmish, as the developers have done an excellent job optimizing the combat mechanics. My initial doubts about the naval combat system were quickly dispelled once I experienced the thrill of decimating numerous fleets simultaneously. The key to success? Knowing when to retreat and regroup before launching a counterattack. Kudos to the development team for delivering an exceptional gaming experience!"}
{"id": 126, "text": "The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought significant changes, especially for the series' protagonist, Dante. Although some fans of the original series may feel nostalgic about the update, the revamped game by Ninja Theory has proven it was worth the transformation. Serving as an excellent entry point for new players, DMC showcases the evolution of an initially arrogant and cynical Dante, tracing his journey towards selflessness. The game masterfully crafts a distinct narrative arc for the new Dante, making him an intriguing character to follow. The story unfolds as Dante is drawn into a corrupt world he had previously chosen to disregard."}
{"id": 127, "text": "I am thoroughly impressed by this game's captivating story, which is full of charm and attention to detail. It's a delightful mix of humor, endearing characters, and unexpected secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is its unique approach to conflict resolution - you don't have to kill anyone, which is a refreshing change of pace. The character designs are well thought out, each with their own distinct personalities and backstories. The game's inspirations from Earthbound are evident, making it stand out even more. Additionally, the soundtrack is simply superb, adding another layer of depth to the overall experience."}
{"id": 128, "text": "I recommend this only because it's free, and it might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. Personally, the \"game\" didn't impress me; its impact relied heavily on shock value, which failed to resonate with me. Perhaps I've become desensitized or the experience was too simplistic to elicit an emotional response. The second part of the game attempts to depict a person's mental deterioration through visual storytelling, addressing themes such as obsession, hallucinations, depression, and more. While the concept is intriguing, the execution fell short for me, as it took mere minutes to complete—including time spent thoroughly reading and absorbing all available details."}
{"id": 129, "text": "Portal is an incredible game that truly showcases the power of innovative design. The concept is straightforward: you're given a set of tools, and then left to figure out how to use them to solve increasingly complex puzzles. What makes Portal so remarkable is its ability to challenge your mind without ever feeling tedious or overwhelming. Even though it doesn't have a dense narrative, it has become a cult classic and spawned one of the most beloved games of 2011. I still enjoy playing it years later, both for the nostalgia factor and to appreciate the foundation of a gaming legend. The gameplay itself is surprisingly simple. You manipulate portals and buttons to progress through each level. There are two types of buttons - ones you can press yourself, and others that require a cube to activate. With these basic elements, Portal manages to create a rich and engaging experience that continues to captivate players."}
{"id": 130, "text": "If you can ignore the few bugs I encountered (one minor and another slightly more frustrating), which have since been addressed with a patch that significantly boosted my frame rate from 60-90 to 80-120, and you're seeking a space exploration game, then I wholeheartedly recommend this title. Most reviews focus on system specifications, so here are mine: an Intel Core i5 6600K (approximately €200), Radeon RX480 graphics card (also around €200), Z170 Pro Gaming motherboard (about €150), and 16GB DDR4 RAM (costing roughly €70). While the total cost of approximately €650 falls within the mid-range budget category, it's worth mentioning that this hardware is relatively new. The game consistently delivers high settings with VSYNC enabled at 60+ frames per second, making it difficult to comprehend how some commenters claim to be running superior setups but struggle with low frame rates."}
{"id": 131, "text": "Do you remember Age of Mythology? It's been that long since we've had an RTS game of such quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes remarkably close to being my new favorite RTS game. Its combination with a grand strategy mode similar to Risk hits the sweet spot for me. I must admit, I have a soft spot for games that allow me to transform into a dragon and aid my troops by supporting, attacking, and commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously. While I enjoy the complexity of modern RTS games like Civilization V, they often feel cluttered, trying to pack too many mechanics, charts, and resources into a single game mode."}
{"id": 132, "text": "Undertale is a masterclass in synergy, where every element blends seamlessly to create a work greater than the sum of its parts. While the graphics are impressive for a retro-style game, the soundtrack stands out as particularly memorable, elevating key moments to new heights. The writing is equally exceptional, deftly navigating a range of emotions – from humor to drama, heartbreak to hope – often within the same scene, all while subverting RPG conventions. With so much to offer, including engaging characters, captivating storytelling, and innovative gameplay mechanics, it's essential playing material for anyone remotely interested in role-playing games or video games in general. In fact, even those with limited time should prioritize experiencing Undertale before their final breath."}
{"id": 133, "text": "If you enjoyed The Witcher 1 and 2, then The Witcher 3 is a must-play. I would typically give this game a perfect score of 10/10, but unfortunately, it has been marred by bugs and random crashes since the 1.03 update. Prior to that, I didn't experience any issues during my playthrough from version 1.00 to 1.03, and the game ran smoothly. However, after the 1.03 patch, the drawing distance has occasionally been poor, only rendering objects or characters when I'm very close. Despite these technical issues, the game remains exceptional, with a tremendous amount of effort put into creating engaging quests, many of which are emotionally resonant and deeply personal. The sheer volume of side quests and the impact of player choices make it a truly immersive experience. I've sunk over 50 hours into the game and am still eager to continue."}

The developers are actively engaged with the community, as evident in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. While there is a challenging learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I'm still in the process of mastering, the depth of strategy offers numerous approaches to achieving goals and capitalizing on situational opportunities. In my opinion, the game is highly replayable, as each session pulls me in, regardless of how the playthrough unfolds."}
{"id": 135, "text": "Warframe offers an initially entertaining experience, providing several enjoyable hours of gameplay. However, as you progress, you may find that the game's combat, enemy designs, and overall gameplay become increasingly repetitive. Despite this drawback, the developers actively update the game with substantial content, including revamped systems, new warframes, and various tweaks. These updates demonstrate their commitment to enhancing the player's experience. While Warframe remains a suitable option for casual gaming, its longevity may be limited due to the repetitive nature of its core mechanics. Nevertheless, since the game is free, I would still suggest giving it a try if you seek a brief gaming escape."}

{"id": 137, "text": "As a politics enthusiast, I was excited to learn about this game that promised to simulate the journey to become president. My initial reaction was, \"Wow, this sounds like fun!\" However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I realized that the game forces players to choose between Republican or Democrat, with no option for independence or third-party affiliation. Despite this limitation, I decided to continue playing to see what else the game had to offer. One aspect that surprised me was the character customization feature, which allowed me to create a personalized avatar. Although the options were somewhat restricted, it was entertaining to experiment with different looks. Notably, it was the only time during the game where I had the freedom to decide whether or not to wear a hat - a minor detail that added some humor to the experience."}

Unfortunately, some keys are hardcoded and cannot be remapped. The game is also plagued by numerous bugs, including instances where my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, requiring me to use console commands to retrieve it. Power armor is readily available early in the game, and power cores are abundant in traders' shops, which lessens its value compared to previous Fallout titles. While the story is unremarkable, the game's stability is a significant improvement over Fallout 3. Despite its lackluster quality, this game was heavily hyped, leading to disappointment. In comparison, it does not surpass either Fallout 3 or New Vegas."}

However, the ending did provide a small measure of redemption after sitting through the closing credits.

Our focus is on the connection between two different approaches to constructing the mirror partner: the Berglund-Hübsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction and the Batyrev construction. The BHK construction employs another weighted projective space and forms the quotient of a new hypersurface $x_{m^t}$ within it by some dual group $g^t$. On the other hand, the Batyrev construction builds the mirror partner as a hypersurface in the toric variety defined by the reflexive polytope dual to the polytope associated with the original Calabi-Yau orbifold.

By carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles, the interference can be restored, regaining sensitivity to the supposedly non-interfering operators. We thoroughly investigate these signatures and discover that the Effective Field Theory (EFT) uncertainties related to higher-dimensional operators can be effectively suppressed using an asymmetry variable that is generated solely by the non-interfering operators. Consequently, the impact of higher-dimensional, interfering operators is downgraded to the level of statistical errors in this observable."}

This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in anti-de Sitter space (AdS), the exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with established quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. To resolve this tension, we need a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the conventional statement at weak coupling.

Our techniques are demonstrated through improvements to the glued-trees problem, where we reduce the hitting time upper bound from $O(n^5)$ to $O(n^2 \\log n)$, and significantly enhance the dependence on precision of Chakraborty et al.'s continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain."}

Previously, dry EMRIs, also known as \"loss-cone\" EMRIs, were thought to be the primary source for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. These occur mainly through multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. However, we bring attention to another formation channel: wet EMRIs, which are facilitated by the accretion flow surrounding accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). The accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits and drives them to migrate towards the MBH, significantly enhancing the formation rate of EMRIs in these galaxies by several orders of magnitude."}

{"id": 228, "text": "Deep learning has effectively addressed numerous issues beyond the capabilities of heuristic algorithms. Its application in wireless communications has also yielded significant successes, despite the fact that existing radio systems are generally well-understood and optimal algorithms are available for various tasks. However, while some progress has been made by focusing on individual components of a receiver, a more effective strategy is to jointly learn the entire receiver system. Unfortunately, this often leads to a complex nonlinear problem that makes it difficult to obtain an optimal solution. To address this challenge, we introduce deeprx, a deep fully convolutional neural network that efficiently executes the complete receiver pipeline – from frequency domain signal streams to unencoded bits – in a 5G-compliant manner. By carefully designing the input of the convolutional neural network using both data and pilot symbols, we ensure precise channel estimation, further enhancing the performance of our proposed approach."}
{"id": 229, "text": "Mutation-based fuzzing commonly employs an initial collection of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) as the foundation for generating new inputs through mutation. However, a large corpus of potential seeds can result in redundant fuzzing efforts, as thousands of similar inputs may be explored. To overcome this limitation, fuzzers are often equipped with distillation tools (such as afl-cmin) that identify the minimal subset of seeds capable of triggering the same breadth of instrumentation data points as the entire corpus. By reducing the number and total size of seeds, fuzzing efficiency can be significantly enhanced, which we investigate systematically. Our study presents the outcomes of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing using five distinct distillation techniques to evaluate their effectiveness in discovering bugs in real-world software."}

These systems can be grouped into multiple subgroups, wherein the agents within each subgroup share identical (isomorphic) state transition structures and can hence be represented using a single template. Leveraging this template, we design a scalable supervisor that exhibits negligible growth in state size and computational complexity when the number of agents increases. Notably, the scalable supervisor remains unaffected by additions or removals of agents from the system, obviating the need for recomputation. By extending our previous findings, we propose necessary and sufficient conditions for both safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we provide an illustrative example of scalable supervisory synthesis."}

In our study, we investigated the anomalous saturation effect of nitrogen vacancies in diamonds under high-power laser excitation, which led to a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. This phenomenon substantially augmented the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, resulting in a modification of the spatial frequency distribution within the fluorescence image. To exploit this effect, we employed a differential excitation protocol, allowing us to retrieve high-frequency details by modulating the excitation laser's power. Our approach yielded approximately 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional confocal microscopy. Owing to its straightforward experimental design and data processing, we anticipate that this technique will prove valuable for enhancing the resolution of sensing and biological labeling applications involving solid-state defects."}

In comparison with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, our Bayesian approach stands out for its ability to achieve both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Through simulations and a real-data example involving a survey of business establishments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various modeling formulations and sampling designs.

However, optimizing discrete hash bits remains a crucial challenge in these methods. A commonly employed strategy involves utilizing an activation function, such as $\\operatorname{sigmoid}$ or $\\operatorname{tanh}$, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximating discrete values. Unfortunately, this approach can lead to a phenomenon known as the \"dead bits problem\" (dbp), where an increasing number of hash bits become trapped in the saturated region of the activation functions, rendering them ineffective. Moreover, the existing quantization loss can exacerbate this issue. To address this problem, we introduce a straightforward yet powerful gradient amplifier that precedes the activation functions, thereby mitigating the effects of dbp."}

The stability of the triplets is constrained by disappearance searches at the LHC and dark matter direct detection experiments, while their decay is constrained by multilepton collider searches. Our results show that a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is excluded by direct detection searches, whereas an unstable triplet with a mass below $230\\ \\text{GeV}$ is excluded at the $95\\%$ confidence level."}

According to this scenario, a initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$ has its eccentricity increased to $e_f$ once the gas disk dissipates due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, yielding a belt spanning $2ae_f$. However, in a slight variation of this scenario, the belts may become even narrower if the planetesimals possess initial eccentricities, potentially arising from earlier planet perturbations during the protoplanetary disc stage when the environment was still rich in gas. Alternatively, the primordial eccentricity could stem from instabilities within the disc itself, boosting its eccentricity without necessitating the presence of planets."}

Could their spin and charge contribute to their energetics, or perhaps interactions with other electrons? In one dimension, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model effectively captures the behavior of interacting electrons at low energies, but experimental observations beyond this linear regime have been scarce. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a tunneling spectroscopy technique to measure many-body modes in gated 1D wires. Our experiments revealed two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, corresponding to spin and charge excitations, as well as the emergence of three additional 1D replica modes that become more pronounced with decreasing wire length. By varying the amount of 1D inter-subband screening, we were able to modify the effective interaction strength within the wires by over 45%, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of interacting electrons in 1D systems."}

Right now, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their periods, yet it's still considered an embarrassing subject to address. From personal experiences and those of others, I can attest that it's draining to navigate this natural process in secret. The constant need to hide sanitary products, conceal painful cramps, and rush to the bathroom undetected takes a mental and physical toll. It's time to break free from these constraints and approach menstruation with the normalcy it deserves."}

Spanning across northern Canada, including Labrador, this vast expanse of wilderness is home to the world's last remaining wild caribou herd, the George River Caribou Herd, which boasts a population of around 400,000 animals. Although I failed to spot any during my visit, the presence of their majestic antlers serves as evidence of their existence. Across the boreal, we are fortunate to have an incredible wealth of wetlands, which are sadly among the most threatened ecosystems globally. These vital habitats play a crucial role in maintaining our environment's health by purifying the air, cleansing water sources, capturing substantial quantities of greenhouse gases, and providing a diverse array of species with a place to thrive."}

Four brothers roamed this divine realm, unaccompanied by any family members or knowledge of their ancestry. Among them, Deminan stood out due to his distinct appearance, his skin covered in painful scabs that prompted him to question his singular affliction. One day, while the Supreme Spirit Yaya tended to his gardens, the four brothers sneaked into his abode. Following a period of feasting and exploration, they chanced upon a massive gourd suspended in the corner. As they attempted to peek inside, their clumsiness resulted in the gourd falling."}

During my time on campus, I attended a career fair where I landed an interview with a startup called Theranos. At the time, information about the company was limited, but what was available was truly impressive. The company aimed to revolutionize healthcare by developing a medical device that allowed patients to obtain their full blood panel results from just a finger prick of blood. This innovation promised not only reduced discomfort but also opened up possibilities for predictive diagnostics, making it a groundbreaking development in the field."}

My family relocated from Southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. We settled in a small Inuit community of only 200 people, where we were among the few non-Inuit families. Life was simple there - we had no television, computers, or even a phone. Our days were filled with outdoor adventures, playing and learning from the Inuit, who became like family to me. The snow and ice served as my playground, and the Inuit taught me everything about surviving and thriving in such an unforgiving environment. It was there that my passion for the polar regions grew into an obsession."}

Our doors are open to those who have exhausted all other options, people who cannot be contained by traditional social safety nets. It's our responsibility to provide a safe and secure environment for both them and society at large. While it's true that we've honed our skills in containing and controlling these populations over time, this shouldn't necessarily be a source of pride. The reality is that we currently imprison more people per capita than any other country globally, and the number of black men behind bars today surpasses the population of enslaved African Americans in 1850."}

But first, let's delve into the origins of our solar system. Four and a half billion years ago, a vast cloud of gas and dust existed. At its core, our sun began to form and eventually ignite. As it did, the particles around it coalesced into planets, comets, and asteroids. Theoretically speaking, Earth suffered massive cometary impacts shortly after its formation, which brought both water and complex organic materials to our planet. These celestial collisions likely jumpstarted the evolution of life."}

Today's discussion is particularly significant, as it addresses pressing issues that have recently come to the forefront. When we initially developed our \"Build Back Better\" series, we aimed to explore ways to tackle challenges stemming from the pandemic. However, recent events, including the tragic death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, have brought a renewed sense of urgency to this topic. We must acknowledge and understand the enormity of this moment before we can even begin to consider how to move forward. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Absolutely, Chris."}

As an avid outdoorsman, Roosevelt relished the opportunity to sleep amidst the towering sequoias and brace himself against the elements during a snowstorm. However, Muir's invitation was motivated by more than mere camaraderie; he sought to enlist Roosevelt's support in protecting Yosemite from encroaching development threats. Despite its designation as protected land since 1864, Yosemite remained vulnerable to overexploitation in 1903, embroiling it in a protracted struggle to balance preservation and public access. This conflict traced back to the 1849 Gold Rush, which brought a deluge of miners to the Sierra Nevada foothills, igniting tensions between environmental stewardship and economic interests."}

Meanwhile, a new drug has been found to extend the lives of patients with a rare disease. While these headlines may grab our attention, they don't always accurately reflect the findings of the medical research they're based on. In fact, there's often a disconnect between the bold, sweeping statements made in headlines and the more nuanced, incremental nature of the research itself. So, how can we avoid being misled by such headlines? The key is to examine the original research that the headlines are reporting on. Let's take a closer look at each of these three headlines and consider a hypothetical research scenario for each one. Keep reading for an explanation of the first example, and then pause to consider the question posed at the end. Bear in mind that these scenarios are oversimplified for illustrative purposes."}

One day, my mom asked me, \"What date should we use for their birthdays?\" My response was, \"Uh, the day they were born, obviously?\" But my mom had a good point - without birth certificates, how could we determine their exact birth dates? This seemed like an insurmountable challenge at the time, but 20 years later, I'm still working on solving a similar issue - albeit on a global scale. Instead of hunting for my brothers' missing birth records, I now focus on addressing the broader problem of lacking birth registration in developing countries. So, what does this have to do with international development?"}

Would you take advantage of this opportunity? That's the query philosopher Robert Nozick poses through his thought experiment, the Experience Machine. In this hypothetical scenario, scientists have crafted a device capable of replicating real-life sensations while assuring exclusively pleasurable encounters, devoid of any discomfort. The caveat is that you must relinquish your connection to reality forever; however, the simulations will be virtually indistinguishable from actual experiences. In essence, the machine offers an infinite sequence of blissful moments, replacing life's customary ebbs and flows. It may seem appealing at first glance, but let's deliberate further."}

{"id": 288, "text": "Carbon follows a natural cycle and is present in all living organisms, including those in soil, oceans, atmospheres, and deep underground rocks. After plants and other living beings perish, most of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere, awaiting reabsorption by newly grown plants. However, over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and marine life gets trapped in rocks and eventually turns into fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Volcanic eruptions trigger the release of some of this captured carbon, while human activities like burning fossil fuels liberate additional quantities of prehistoric carbon. Currently, human activities release approximately 60 times more carbon annually than all volcanoes combined."}

However, one of the primary contrasts between natural and human technologies lies in their resilience. Robust systems remain stable in diverse and unpredictable environments. Cockroaches, for instance, can maintain their balance while traversing uneven terrain, thanks to their remarkably adaptive legs. By equipping them with a jet pack or introducing disturbances like earthquakes, researchers found that these creatures can self-stabilize effortlessly, sans cognitive input. Not only do they navigate intricate terrain like grass with ease, but they also exhibit a newly discovered behavior - instinctively rolling onto their sides to traverse artificial obstacles. Moreover, robust systems possess the ability to perform various functions using the same structural design. This novel discovery sheds light on the fascinating ways in which living organisms adapt and thrive in challenging environments."}

Adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogacy have expanded traditional notions of parenting, raising important questions about how to navigate these new realities. As a philosopher and social scientist, I have studied these issues extensively, but today, I want to share insights gained from conversations with actual parents and children. Their experiences highlight what truly matters in a family, regardless of its configuration. For instance, should we inform our child about the sperm donation process? If so, when and how do we broach the subject? While some refer to sperm donors as 'biological fathers,' is this term appropriate? By examining these concerns, we can gain a deeper understanding of contemporary parenthood."}

While the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison and the severity of our legal system were certainly obstacles, they weren't the factors that ultimately propelled me forward. Instead, it was the transformative power of education that changed my trajectory. Just a few weeks before my release on parole, a guidance counselor encouraged me to enroll in a newly launched college course within the prison walls.
